## Phase 3 closure verdict

`PHASE_3_LIVE_CLOSED`

The approved Phase 3 same-entity property vertical slice is complete and live-verified.

Live trace property:
`9927b705-7b9d-4f4c-a7cf-903c4a330ae2`

Verified flow:

1. Owner created the disposable QA property.
2. Owner uploaded real media through the standard property media flow.
3. Owner submitted the property for review.
4. Admin queue showed the same property ID.
5. Admin Detail loaded the same canonical property and media.
6. Admin approved it.
7. Canonical persisted state became `PUBLISHED + VERIFIED`.
8. The existing Owner session revalidated the same property without browser reload or re-authentication and showed the published state.
9. Customer Explore returned the same property.
10. Customer Detail fetched the same property ID and rendered canonical description, amenities, images, price, capacity, location, type, and applicable house rules without fabricated fallbacks.

The disposable QA property was archived afterwards through the standard Owner API.

## Phase 3 implementation outcomes

### Task 3.9 — Owner external-state revalidation

Closed.

- Property-scoped revalidation only.
- No broad multi-domain refresh requirement.
- Focus / visibility revalidation supported.
- Revalidation failure remains visible and retryable.
- Out-of-order response protection prevents an older request from overwriting newer canonical state.

### Task 3.11 — Customer canonical Property Detail

Closed.

- `GET /api/v1/customer/properties/:id` is the canonical detail source.
- Required canonical detail payload is validated fail-closed.
- Canonical empty images remain authoritative.
- Location does not fall back to stale Explore data after detail success.
- Canonical capacity drives guest limits.
- Canonical unit/property type, description, amenities, images, and persisted house-rule content are rendered truthfully.
- Loading/error/retry states remain explicit.

## Phase 3 publication evidence

- PR #19 merged into `main`.
- Phase 3 main SHA: `9ef59f64008db16df0386ac92c5d64bfc8c73b58`.
- Main CI run `34007323794`: `completed / success`.
- Owner, Customer, Admin, and Backend validation jobs succeeded.
- Cloudflare Worker deployment step succeeded.
- Live vertical slice result: `PHASE_3_LIVE_PASS`.

## Boundaries preserved

- No database schema change.
- No migration or RPC change.
- No booking, availability, or finance business-rule change.
- No architecture change.
- No broad Phase 4–7 UI redesign was introduced into Phase 3.

# Founder Phase 4 Entry Decision — 2026-09-06

The previous next gate was:

`STOP_BEFORE_PHASE_4`

That stop was intentionally waiting for explicit Founder continuation and UI/UX Design Lab / LAP entry.

The Founder has now explicitly resumed the program and authorized Phase 4 entry.

Current gate:

`PHASE_4_ENTRY_AUTHORIZED`

Meaning:

- Phase 4 may begin.
- LAP formally joins the Phase 4–7 design program.
- Bridge remains responsible for protecting architecture/business/finance rules and translating approved design into safe implementation packages.
- R2–R5 from the Pre-Phase-4 remediation plan are **deferred, not closed**.
- Their mandatory return point is after Phase 7 and before Phase 8.
- The canonical deferred closure contract is `tasks/POST_PHASE_7_DEFERRED_CLOSURE.md`.

Do not re-block Phase 4 merely because older remediation text required R5 before Phase 4; the Founder explicitly changed the execution timing while preserving the deferred obligations.

## Immediate next work

Begin the Phase 4 Unified Design System / UI/UX Design Lab × Bridge kickoff under the approved design operating contract.

Do not automatically implement new functional/business capabilities discovered by design. Record them as dependencies/deferred opportunities unless the Founder explicitly pulls them forward.
