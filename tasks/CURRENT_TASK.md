# Active Task — CUSTOMER_SCREENS_13_14

STATUS: IN_PROGRESS_LOCAL_TAKEOVER
BRANCH: phase5/customer-screens13-14-stay-hub-payment
BASE_MAIN_SHA: 85a3fc8734d258babd60295c4a9d65b96b01e0ed
SCOPE: Customer Screen 13 Booking Details / Stay Hub and Screen 14 Prototype Deposit Payment.
NON_GOALS: no live payment provider, no Screen 15, no PR #48 changes, no production mutation.
VALIDATION: customer typecheck/build; Screen 11/12/Auth regression tests; Screen 13/14 tests; backend payment boundary tests.

The historical Phase 5 roadmap below is preserved as evidence. This active
contract supersedes its stale "next target" wording for this branch only.

## Customer Screen 12 Live Verification Summary
- **Dedicated Auth V2 Origin (`BOOKINGS_TAB`)**:
  - Guest taps "حجوزاتي" -> Screen 12 renders clean Guest state with heading `سجّل الدخول لعرض حجوزاتك`.
  - Tapping "تسجيل الدخول" opens Auth V2 with origin `BOOKINGS_TAB` and intent `LOGIN`.
  - Cancelling Auth V2 returns directly to Screen 12 on tab "حجوزاتي" in Guest state.
- **Session Expired State**:
  - HTTP 401 on `/api/v1/customer/bookings` safely triggers `CustomerBookingsUnauthorizedError`.
  - Renders high-contrast amber session expired card: `انتهت جلسة تسجيل الدخول` with CTA `تسجيل الدخول مجددًا`.
  - Fails closed: clears all private bookings, active booking, detail modal ID, and recent submission banner.
- **True Empty State**:
  - Authenticated customer with 0 bookings renders `لا توجد حجوزات بعد` with subtext and CTA `استكشف الإقامات`.
  - Tapping `استكشف الإقامات` switches active tab to `استكشف`.
- **Real Canonical Bookings & Status Matrix**:
  - Live customer `+201049892908` loaded canonical bookings `BK-183223` and `BK-908747`.
  - Bookings rendered under section `السابقة` with badge `ملغي من جانبك` and icon `CircleSlash2`.
  - Absolute status truth: strictly prohibits `مرفوض` or `لم يوافق المالك` for cancellations.
  - Section `يحتاج إجراء منك` conditionally omitted when no `APPROVED_PENDING_PAYMENT` bookings exist.
- **Bottom Navigation Attention Dot**:
  - KONFRM Blue `#0059FF` dot (no green, no pulse) only active when `APPROVED_PENDING_PAYMENT` is present.
  - Correctly evaluated to `false` during live verification.
- **Single Clickable Card Surface & Screen 13 Integration**:
  - 44×44px accessible refresh button (`aria-label="تحديث الحجوزات"`).
  - Clicking card routes to Screen 13 `BookingDetailModal` by `booking.id`.
  - Closing Screen 13 cleanly restores Screen 12 without reload.
- **Responsive Visual Integrity**:
  - Multi-viewport screenshots saved and visually inspected:
    - `screen12_live_360x800.png` (Compact Android)
    - `screen12_live_390x844.png` (iPhone 14/15 standard)
    - `screen12_live_430x932.png` (iPhone Pro Max)
    - `screen12_live_guest.png` (Guest state)
    - `screen12_live_session_expired.png` (Session expired state)
    - `screen12_live_empty_state.png` (True empty state)


## Phase 3 closure verdict

`PHASE_3_LIVE_CLOSED`

The approved Phase 3 same-entity property vertical slice is complete and live-verified.

Live trace property:
`9927b705-7b9d-4f4c-a7cf-903c4a330ae2`

Verified flow:

1. Owner created the disposable QA property.
2. Owner uploaded real media through the standard property media flow.
3. Owner submitted the property for review.
4. Admin queue showed the same property ID.
5. Admin Detail loaded the same canonical property and media.
6. Admin approved it.
7. Canonical persisted state became `PUBLISHED + VERIFIED`.
8. The existing Owner session revalidated the same property without browser reload or re-authentication and showed the published state.
9. Customer Explore returned the same property.
10. Customer Detail fetched the same property ID and rendered canonical description, amenities, images, price, capacity, location, type, and applicable house rules without fabricated fallbacks.

The disposable QA property was archived afterwards through the standard Owner API.

## Phase 3 implementation outcomes

### Task 3.9 — Owner external-state revalidation

Closed.

- Property-scoped revalidation only.
- No broad multi-domain refresh requirement.
- Focus / visibility revalidation supported.
- Revalidation failure remains visible and retryable.
- Out-of-order response protection prevents an older request from overwriting newer canonical state.

### Task 3.11 — Customer canonical Property Detail

Closed.

- `GET /api/v1/customer/properties/:id` is the canonical detail source.
- Required canonical detail payload is validated fail-closed.
- Canonical empty images remain authoritative.
- Location does not fall back to stale Explore data after detail success.
- Canonical capacity drives guest limits.
- Canonical unit/property type, description, amenities, images, and persisted house-rule content are rendered truthfully.
- Loading/error/retry states remain explicit.

## Phase 3 publication evidence

- PR #19 merged into `main`.
- Phase 3 main SHA: `9ef59f64008db16df0386ac92c5d64bfc8c73b58`.
- Main CI run `34007323794`: `completed / success`.
- Owner, Customer, Admin, and Backend validation jobs succeeded.
- Cloudflare Worker deployment step succeeded.
- Live vertical slice result: `PHASE_3_LIVE_PASS`.

## Boundaries preserved

- No database schema change.
- No migration or RPC change.
- No booking, availability, or finance business-rule change.
- No architecture change.
- No broad Phase 4–7 UI redesign was introduced into Phase 3.

# Founder Phase 4 Entry Decision — 2026-09-06

The previous next gate was:

`STOP_BEFORE_PHASE_4`

That stop was intentionally waiting for explicit Founder continuation and UI/UX Design Lab / LAP entry.

The Founder has now explicitly resumed the program and authorized Phase 4 entry.

Current gate:

`PHASE_4_ENTRY_AUTHORIZED`

Meaning:

- Phase 4 may begin.
- LAP formally joins the Phase 4–7 design program.
- Bridge remains responsible for protecting architecture/business/finance rules and translating approved design into safe implementation packages.
- R2–R5 from the Pre-Phase-4 remediation plan are **deferred, not closed**.
- Their mandatory return point is after Phase 7 and before Phase 8.
- The canonical deferred closure contract is `tasks/POST_PHASE_7_DEFERRED_CLOSURE.md`.

Do not re-block Phase 4 merely because older remediation text required R5 before Phase 4; the Founder explicitly changed the execution timing while preserving the deferred obligations.

## Immediate next work

1. **Phase 4 UX Test Lane (`PHASE_4_UX_TEST_LANE`):** `LIVE_PROVISIONED_READY`.
   - Complete isolated test lane provisioned for `P4_UX_CUSTOMER`, `P4_UX_OWNER`, and `P4_UX_ADMIN`.
   - Real-behavior fixtures: Property A (Published), Property B (Pending Review in Admin Queue), Availability Block, and Booking Request.
   - Credentials secured locally in Windows Credential Manager (`KONFRM/UXTL/P4/*`); zero secrets in git.
   - Specification and tooling guide: [`tasks/PHASE_4_UX_TEST_LANE.md`](./PHASE_4_UX_TEST_LANE.md).
2. Begin the Phase 4 Unified Design System / UI/UX Design Lab × Bridge kickoff under the approved design operating contract using the active UX Test Lane for auditing and evaluation.

Do not automatically implement new functional/business capabilities discovered by design. Record them as dependencies/deferred opportunities unless the Founder explicitly pulls them forward.
